<b> Meet The Brewer: </b> 

Thomas founded WeilerBrau Brewing with his brother in 1991, beginning with kit brews on the kitchen stove.  Over the past 30+ years he has mastered the craft of all grain brewing incorporating home grown and dried hops.  Tom brews a wide range of styles, including pale ales, English bitters, stouts, and more.

<b> Meet The Assistant Brewer: </b> 

Michaelâ€™s journey into microbiology began early.  For his 8th grade science fair project he tested the hypothesis that in the presence of yeast, more sugar will yield more alcohol.  Through rigorous experimentation he found that indeed it does.  Michael published his findings "Fermentation of Juice".  His work earned him recognition in the field of zymurgy and a spot at the 2005 Illinois State Science Fair held at the University of Illinois at Champaign.
